# Implementation Changes for Content Skimmer

## Overview

This document outlines the required implementation changes for the `content-skimmer` service to support robust, scalable, and future-proof search and discovery, as described in the `SEARCH_STRATEGY.md`. It also provides a comprehensive prompt to guide the initialization of these changes.

## Implementation Changes

### 1. **Search Index Integration**
- Add a modular integration layer for pushing searchable fields (e.g., title, summary, entities, tags) to a dedicated search engine (Meilisearch, Typesense, or Cloudflare Vectorize) after each successful skim/enrichment.
- Ensure the integration is stateless, event-driven, and supports both keyword and semantic search engines.

### 2. **Event-Driven Sync**
- On every create, update, or delete of content or AI results, trigger a sync to the search index.
- Implement retry and dead-letter handling for failed syncs to ensure data consistency.

### 3. **Hybrid Storage Logic**
- Store small, structured AI results (summaries, entities, enrichment) in D1.
- For large or unstructured outputs, store in R2 and keep a reference (URL/key) in D1.
- Ensure only appropriate fields are indexed for search.

### 4. **Security & Access Control**
- Secure all outbound calls to the search engine.
- Ensure only authorized events can trigger indexing and updates.

### 5. **Extensibility**
- Make the search integration pluggable, allowing for easy swapping or addition of search engines in the future.

### 6. **Monitoring & Logging**
- Add observability for all indexing operations, including success, failure, and performance metrics.

## Initialization Prompt

> Implement the following in the `content-skimmer` Cloudflare Worker project:
>
> 1. Add a modular search integration layer to push searchable fields (title, summary, entities, tags, etc.) to a dedicated search/indexing engine (Meilisearch, Typesense, or Cloudflare Vectorize) after each successful AI skim/enrichment.
> 2. Ensure all indexing operations are stateless, event-driven, and support both keyword and semantic search engines.
> 3. On every create, update, or delete of content or AI results, trigger a sync to the search index, with retry and dead-letter handling for failures.
> 4. Store small, structured AI results in D1; store large/unstructured outputs in R2 and reference them in D1.
> 5. Secure all outbound calls to the search engine and ensure only authorized events can trigger indexing.
> 6. Make the search integration pluggable for future extensibility.
> 7. Add monitoring and logging for all indexing operations.
>
> The implementation should be TypeScript-first, stateless, modular, and compatible with Cloudflare Workers, R2, and D1. All AI provider integrations must remain pluggable and support fallback. Prioritize security, scalability, and
