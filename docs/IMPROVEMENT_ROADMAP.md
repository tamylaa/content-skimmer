## Architectural Evolution: From Integration Layers to Dedicated Pipelines

- **Search Integration Layer ‚Üí Search Sync Service:**
	- The current modular search integration should evolve into a dedicated, loosely coupled Search Sync Service. This service will handle all indexing, reindexing, and multi-engine sync, enabling independent scaling and advanced features (analytics, reindex, hybrid search, etc.).

- **Extraction Layer ‚Üí Enrichment Pipeline:**
	- Move from basic extraction (summary, entities, topics) to a full enrichment pipeline. This pipeline should support embeddings, relationships, multi-modal features, and be extensible for new enrichment types as search and downstream needs evolve.

**Segregation and Loose Coupling:**
- Keep search sync, enrichment, and core processing as separate, well-defined modules/services.
- Use event-driven communication (e.g., Cloudflare Queues, webhooks) for decoupling and future expansion.

---

## Implementation Tracking & Plan Alignment

- Maintain a living Implementation Plan (see IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) that is updated as new architectural ideas are adopted.
- For each major capability (e.g., enrichment pipeline, search sync service), add a section in the plan with:
	- **Goal/Scope**
	- **Design/Architecture**
	- **Implementation Steps**
	- **Status/Progress**
- Use checklists or tables to track progress and ensure alignment with the roadmap.
- Regularly review and refactor to keep modules loosely coupled and ready for future expansion.

---

This roadmap should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project evolves.

## Cost Optimization Strategy

**Current Cost Challenges:**
- AI model usage can be expensive at scale
- Processing all files equally regardless of value
- No caching of similar content
- Unlimited token usage per request

**Implemented Cost Optimizations:**

### 1. **Intelligent Processing Decisions**
- **Content-based routing**: High-value content (contracts, financial docs) gets full AI processing
- **Size-based limits**: Large files use light processing or basic enrichment only
- **Priority system**: User-defined priority can override cost limits
- **Budget controls**: Daily spending limits and per-file cost caps

### 2. **Tiered Processing Strategies**
- **Basic Enrichment**: Free regex/rule-based analysis (entities, topics, sentiment)
- **AI-Light**: Truncated content with focused prompts (2-3 sentence summaries)
- **AI-Full**: Complete analysis for high-value content
- **Cached Results**: Zero-cost retrieval of previously processed similar content

### 3. **Environment-Specific Configurations**
- **Development**: $10/day budget, 2K token limit, aggressive caching
- **Production**: $100/day budget, 8K token limit, balanced processing
- **High-Volume**: $200/day budget, 4K token limit, cost-first approach

### 4. **Content Caching**
- **Smart hashing**: Similar content reuses previous AI results
- **24-hour cache lifetime**: Fresh analysis for time-sensitive content
- **Cache hit tracking**: Monitor cost savings from reused results

### 5. **Real-time Cost Monitoring**
- **Live spending tracking**: Monitor daily budget consumption
- **Cost per file metrics**: Track average processing costs
- **Strategy effectiveness**: Compare AI vs basic enrichment outcomes

**Cost Reduction Strategies:**
- Start with free basic enrichment for all files
- Use AI selectively based on content value and type
- Cache results aggressively to avoid reprocessing
- Implement circuit breakers to prevent cost overruns
- Monitor and adjust thresholds based on actual usage patterns

**Expected Savings:**
- 60-80% cost reduction through intelligent routing
- 30-50% savings from caching similar content
- Predictable spending with budget controls
- Better ROI by focusing AI on high-value content

## Multi-Search Engine Support: Need and Benefits

**What is Multi-Search Engine Support?**

The content-skimmer is designed to support multiple search engines, such as Meilisearch (for keyword/faceted search) and Cloudflare Vectorize (for semantic/embedding-based search). This is achieved through a modular search integration layer, allowing the system to push content to one or more search backends.

**Why is this needed?**

- **Flexibility:** Different use cases require different search capabilities. Keyword search is fast and familiar, while semantic search enables more natural, intent-based queries.
- **Future-proofing:** As search technology evolves, supporting multiple engines allows easy adoption of new features or migration between providers.
- **Redundancy:** If one search engine is unavailable or degraded, the other can serve as a fallback, improving reliability.
- **Hybrid Search:** Combining keyword and semantic search can deliver richer, more relevant results to users and downstream services.
- **Downstream Enablement:** Downstream services (e.g., dashboards, analytics, campaign tools) can choose the best search engine for their needs, or even use both for advanced scenarios.

**How does this improve content-skimmer and downstream services?**

- Enables advanced discovery features (semantic, faceted, and hybrid search)
- Supports rapid iteration and experimentation with new search technologies
- Improves resilience and reliability of search-dependent workflows
- Allows downstream services to build richer, more user-friendly search and selection experiences

**Implementation Note:**

While the codebase includes the foundation for multi-search engine support, ensure that both Meilisearch and Vectorize are fully integrated, tested, and documented. Downstream services should be informed of the available search capabilities and best practices for integration.
